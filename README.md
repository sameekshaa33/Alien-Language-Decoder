🛸 Alien Language Decoder
A Fun Console-Based Program to Decode Alien Messages Using Symbol-to-Letter Mapping
📘 Overview

The Alien Language Decoder is a creative Python project where users decode mysterious alien messages using custom symbol-to-letter substitution. It is designed to help learners strengthen their skills in:

    Input validation

    Dictionaries

    Loops

    String manipulation

    User interaction in terminal-based applications

This project combines creativity with core Python programming concepts, making it a great beginner-friendly mini project with a unique twist.
🎯 Features

    Console-based user interface

    Accepts user-defined mappings from alien symbols to English letters

    Decodes alien messages using the given mappings

    Handles input errors gracefully

    Encourages logical thinking and string processing skills

🛠️ Tech Stack

    Language: Python 3

    Libraries: No external libraries used – built only with core Python

    Platform: Console/Terminal

🧪 How It Works

    An alien message made of symbols (like @, #, *, &, !) is displayed.

    The user is prompted to assign an English letter to each symbol.

    The program replaces each symbol with the corresponding letter and outputs the decoded message.

▶️ Example

Welcome to the Alien Language Decoder!
Alien messages use unique symbols.
You will try to decode the message by mapping symbols to letters.

Here is the alien message:
@#*#& @&* #*!!

The alien language uses these symbols:
@ # * & !
Map each symbol to an English letter (a-z).
Enter letter for symbol '@': h
Enter letter for symbol '#': e
Enter letter for symbol '*': l
Enter letter for symbol '&': o
Enter letter for symbol '!': d

Decoding the message with your mappings...

Decoded message:
hello holo leddd

Thank you for using the Alien Language Decoder!

💡 Ideas for Future Improvements

    Allow the user to enter their own alien message

    Validate that the decoded output contains valid English words

    Add GUI version using Tkinter or PyQt

    Save/load user-defined mappings from a file

    Introduce frequency analysis or brute-force decoding for more challenge
